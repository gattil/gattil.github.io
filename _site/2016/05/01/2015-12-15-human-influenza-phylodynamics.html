<p>During the course of evolution, pathogens exploited new and better strategies to infect the human body. A well-known case is influenza disease, which evolves extremely rapidly in order to escape and elude the human immune system. With the increasing of availability of molecular data, new computational methods (i.e. phylodynamic models) are needed to describe and unveil the close association between a more-and-more global and dynamic society and its pathogens.</p>
