I was born in Brescia in 1989. I grew up in Franciacorta's country side, a beautiful place where you can appreciate the incredible landscapes drinking superb wines.

From Sept'03 until June'08 I attended the high school @ Istituto Madonna della Neve in Adro (BS) - IT where I focused my attention on classical studies and in June'08 I obtained the "Maturità Classica" (humanistic studies) high school degree.

I decided to shift my studies into biological sciences from 2008 until 2011, period of time during which I studied and I obtained the Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology bachelor degree @ University of Milan - IT on Oct'11.

I moved to Zürich (Switzerland) on Feb'12 where I attended a two-years Master Course in Computational Biology and Bioinformatic @ Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETHZ).

In Feb'13 I joined [Prof. Konrad Basler](http://www.imls.uzh.ch/en/research/basler.html) group for a small research project (lab rotation) @ IMLS (Institute of Molecular Life Sciences - University of Zürich) under the supervision of [Dr. Simon Restrepo](http://bioimaging.usc.edu/index.html) that successfully ended in Oct'13.

From June'14 to Jan'15, after my master thesis project on modelling D. melanogaster tubular organs through FEM simulations, I was a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Konrad Basler (UZH)](http://www.imls.uzh.ch/en/research/basler.html) and [Dr. Yanlan Mao (UCL)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lmcb/users/yanlan-mao). In this period of time, I was involved in the software engineering of [EpiTools](http://imls-bg-arthemis.uzh.ch/epitools-wiki/site/home/), an image processing software for epithelial tissues.

Starting from Feb'15, I joined [Dr. Maria Anisimova](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/anis/) bioinformatics group as a PhD candidate in computational science and phylogenetics at Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Wädenswil (ZH).

## Research

I am currently studying the evolutionary molecular and epidemiological dynamics of viral diseases affecting the human population on a global scale.
