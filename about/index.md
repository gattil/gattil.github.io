I was born in Brescia in 1989. I grew up in Franciacorta's country side, a beautiful place where you can appreciate the incredible landscapes drinking superb wines.

From Sept'03 until June'08 I attended the high school @ Istituto Madonna della Neve in Adro (BS) - IT where I focused my attention on classical studies and in June'08 I obtained the "Maturità Classica" (humanistic studies) high school degree.

I decided to shift my studies into biological sciences from 2008 until 2011, period of time during which I studied and I obtained the Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology bachelor degree @ University of Milan - IT on Oct'11.

I moved to Zürich (Switzerland) on Feb'12 where I attended a two-years Master Course in Computational Biology and Bioinformatic @ Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETHZ).

In Feb'13 I joined Prof. Konrad Basler group for a small research project (lab rotation) @ IMLS (Institute of Molecular Life Sciences - University of Zürich) under the supervision of Dr. Simon Restrepo that successfully ended in Oct'13.

From June'14 to Jan'15, after my master thesis project on modelling D. melanogaster tubular organs development via FEM simulations, I was a Research Assistant under the supervision of Prof. Konrad Basler (UZH) and Dr. Yanlan Mao (UCL). In this period of time, I was involved in the software engineering of EpiTools, an image processing software for epithelial tissues.

From Feb'15, I joined Dr. Maria Anisimova bioinformatics group as a PhD candidate in computational science and phylogenetics at Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Wädenswil, ZH

## Research

I am currently studying the evolutionary molecular and epidemiological dynamics of viral diseases affecting the human population on a global scale.
