I"m$<p>I was born in Brescia in 1989. I grew up in Franciacorta’s country side, a beautiful place where you can appreciate the incredible landscapes drinking superb wines.</p>

<p>From Sept ‘03 until June’08 I attended the high school @ Istituto Madonna della Neve in Adro (BS) - IT where I focused my attention on classical studies and in June ‘08 I obtained the “Maturità Classica” (humanistic studies) high school degree.</p>

<p>I decided to shift my studies into biological sciences from 2008 until 2011, period of time during which I studied and I obtained the Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology bachelor degree @ University of Milan - IT on Oct ‘11.</p>

<p>I moved to Zürich (Switzerland) on Feb ‘12 where I attended a two-years Master Course in Computational Biology and Bioinformatic @ Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETHZ).</p>

<p>In Feb ‘13 I joined <a href="http://www.imls.uzh.ch/en/research/basler.html">Prof. Konrad Basler</a> group for a small research project (lab rotation) @ IMLS (Institute of Molecular Life Sciences - University of Zürich) under the supervision of <a href="http://bioimaging.usc.edu/index.html">Dr. Simon Restrepo</a> that successfully ended in Oct’13.</p>

<p>From June ‘14 to Jan ‘15, after my master thesis project on modelling D. melanogaster tubular organs through FEM simulations, I was a Research Assistant under the supervision of <a href="http://www.imls.uzh.ch/en/research/basler.html">Prof. Konrad Basler (UZH)</a> and <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lmcb/users/yanlan-mao">Dr. Yanlan Mao (UCL)</a>. In this period of time, I was involved in the software engineering of <a href="http://imls-bg-arthemis.uzh.ch/epitools-wiki/site/home/">EpiTools</a>, an image processing software for epithelial tissues.</p>

<p>In Feb’15, I joined <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/anis/">Dr. Maria Anisimova</a> bioinformatics group as a PhD candidate in computational science and phylogenetics at Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Wädenswil (ZH). In Feb ‘18, I moved back to University of Zurich to complete my PhD in the group of <a href="http://www.imls.uzh.ch/en/research/vonmering.html">Prof. Dr. Christian von Mering</a>. On 4<sup>th</sup> Dec ‘18, I defended my PhD thesis titled “Realistic Evolutionary Models for Phylogenetic-Guided Analyses” and I successfully passed the doctoral exam at University of Zurich.</p>

<p>Since Aug, ‘19, I am a non-executive board member of <a href="https://navacamicie.com">Country Rose SRL</a>, a shirt company founded by my parents. In this role, I am responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strategic consulting and development lead for logistic and manufacturing processes</li>
  <li>Development of web-application for data aggregation and financial transaction processing</li>
  <li>Design, deployment and maintenance of network and unified communication infrastructure</li>
  <li>Maintenance of heterogeneous and legacy IT environments</li>
</ul>

<p>Until Apr ‘20, I worked as <strong>Cloud Engineer/Architect</strong> at <a href="http://www.amanox.ch">Amanox Solutions AG</a>, in Bern (CH), and in this role:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I was involved in the definition, the implementation, and the support of cutting-edge data analytics and machine learning projects.</li>
  <li>I promoted the introduction of DevSecOps strategies for the development and deployment of applications and services on the cloud</li>
  <li>I advised on how to develop elastic solutions using stateless deployments and serverless infrastructure.</li>
  <li>I devised solutions which leveraged cloud architecture best practices, and the implementation of cloud adoption frameworks to ensure data integrity and the minimisation of possible failure scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<p>I assisted many customers during their journey to the cloud. Among my clients, I worked with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.fam.ch/">Fisch Asset Management, Zürich</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.straumann.com/">Institut Straumann AG, Basel</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.clariant.com/">Clariant, Basel</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.alpiq.com/">Alpiq AG, Olten</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In June ‘20, I started working in the Digital &amp; Commerce Tecnology department at <a href="https://www.alpiq.com/">Alpiq, AG</a>. At first I covered the role of <strong>Cloud Engineer</strong> in the Application Operation Support team, and lately I took on the responsibility as <strong>Technical Lead</strong>. In this role, I coordinate the implementation and execution of business-driven cloud projects, and I support the introduction of DevSecOps strategies and cloud-inspired engineering best practices.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>I studied the evolutionary molecular and epidemiological dynamics of viral diseases affecting the human population on a global scale, and how to implement a new class of evolutionary models which account for incorporing insertion and deletions events into phylogenetic reconstruction.</p>
